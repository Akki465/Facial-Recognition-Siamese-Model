# Facial Recognition using Siamese model 

A Siamese neural network, implemented using TensorFlow, to perform one-shot image recognition

Model follows that detailed in this research paper - https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/oneshot1.pdf

**Dataset:** Uses the Labelled Faces in the Wild dataset - https://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/ - for negative images. Webcam with OpenCV VideoCapture for positive and anchor image collection.
